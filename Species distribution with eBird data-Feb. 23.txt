**Estimating Species Distribution With MODIS Land Cover Products and eBird Community Science Data**

___

Community Science (CS) involves the collaboration between scientists and civilians that provides them an opportunity to contribute meaningful data to key scientific studies. A paper published in Diversity and Distributions by Johnston et al. (2021) describes the use of land data cover from the MODIS product MCD12Q1 (Frieidl, M., Sulla-Menshe, D. 2022) to create species distribution maps from data acquired from eBird. eBird is a free application developed by The Cornell Lab of Ornithology which provides birdwatchers the opportunity to contribute to biodiversity-related science projects. More than 100 million bird sightings are contributed annually by eBirders (The Cornell Lab of Ornithology, n.d). These sightings are then used in studies to describe distributions among the different species both temporally and spatially.


One of the most common ways CS is done involves recording of species through observations by the public. This type of data contribution presents three challenges for scientists: first the location of the participants are typically spatially biased due to accessibility, second the observation is typically heterogeneous with variation in effort, time of day, and weather, and third the preference for certain species may lead to biased recordings (Johnston et al.,2021). These challenges can disrupt distribution models and have biased results so a more analytical approach to these false negatives allows for a more accurate model. Checklists are utilized when recording bird observations with eBird which include species identification and number of individuals.


In this paper, researchers focused on two different species: the wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), and the Chuck-will’s-widow (Antrostomus carolinensis). Their data was pulled from the eBird Basic Dataset (EBD) from the May 2019 version with a geographically distinct region (BCR27) that included parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.  When trying to model occupancy of these species they pulled land cover data from MODIS using four different land cover variables for each. The wood thrush (deciduous broadleaf forest, mixed forest, croplands, and urban), and the chuck-will’s-widow (evergreen needleleaf, deciduous broadleaf, mixed forest, urban) (Johnston et al., 2021).

Covariates were added to the eBird checklists and included start time of birding activity, duration of birding activity, recording if the observer was stationally or traveling, distance travelled, and the number of observers. This allows a more accurate model to be fitted if the whole checklist was completed. Models were estimated from presence-only (models 2/3), semi-completed checklists (models 4/5) to completed checklists (model 6/7). Model 7 shows the most accurate occupancy and encounter rate because this included completed checklists and most related environments pulled from the MODIS products.

[eBird](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/stac/LPCLOUD?page=12) has many different features that allow the community to contribute to ongoing science studies. Creating an account allows you to directly downnload data that you are interested in and to upload sightings. Data and tools found on the website encourage scientists to use the open science information to access, analyze, and cite eBird data for free.

A great way to use eBird data is through R studio. This allows you to produce models that estimate ranges, occupancy, abundance and much more. The ebirdst R package provides tools for downloading data products, loading them into R, and use it for visualizations and analysis. Visit [eBird.github](https://ebird.github.io/ebirdst/) for an overview of how to install ebirdst and a guide on how to download data.
